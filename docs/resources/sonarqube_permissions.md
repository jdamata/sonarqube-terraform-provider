# sonarqube_permissions

Provides a Sonarqube Permissions resource. This can be used to manage global and project permissions.

## Example: Set global admin permissions for a group called "my-admins"

```terraform
resource "sonarqube_permissions" "my_global_admins" {
    group_name  = "my-admins"
    permissions = ["admin"]
}
```

## Example: Set project admin permissions for a group called "my-project-admins"

```terraform
resource "sonarqube_permissions" "my_project_admins" {
    group_name  = "my-project-admins"
    project_key = "my-project"
    permissions = ["admin"]
}
```

## Example: Set project admin permissions for a group called "my-project-admins on a permission template"

```terraform
resource "sonarqube_permissions" "internal_admins" {
    group_name  = "my-internal-admins"
    template_id = sonarqube_permission_template.template.id
    permissions = ["admin"]
}
```

## Example: Set codeviewer & user permissions on project level for a user called "johndoe"

```terraform
resource "sonarqube_permissions" "john_project_read" {
    login_name  = "johndoe"
    project_key = "my-project"
    permissions = ["codeviewer", "user"]
}
```
